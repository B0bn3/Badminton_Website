            <h1>What is Badminton?</h1>
            <p>Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport played by two players (singles) or four players (doubles). The aim is to hit a shuttlecock over a net so that it lands in your opponent’s court. It is known for its quick reactions, fast rallies, and exciting smashes. Badminton can be played indoors or outdoors, but professional games are always played indoors to avoid wind interference.</p>
